1. Itoko version.

- She is your cousin. She used to live next to you when you were kids. She mentions being your sister as a joke for living with you, innocently at first. she visits you mentioning having missed you and heard from your mother that you weren't feeling very well, possibly you would end up dead by kar≈çshi.


2. Explicit version. 

- It's the same as the first version, but she's somewhat obsessed with you. the dialogue is slightly more explicit.



3. Onee-san version. 

- She is actually your sister. she can't resist lust despite mentioning she's doing something forbidden.
